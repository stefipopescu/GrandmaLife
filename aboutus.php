The Philosophy
The Grandma Life philosophy is about reminding you how to be you.  Living a Grandma Life isn't about finding a man, achieving career success or getting super healthy (although if you can do that as well, that's ok too).  Its about enjoying your life, whatever that life may be.  We like to think of it as fun mindfulness.


The principles:

1. Enjoy your own company- you can have the best times of your life just on your own.  After all, who has more common with you, and knows you better, than yourself?

2. Appreciate friendship- whilst staying true to principle 1, grandma life appreciates true friendship which no partner should come between.  Grandma Life can be best explained to potential partners in a beautiful treatise called Wannabe.  Especially the part about 'If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends'.  Wise words. 

3.  Stay nice- part of being the best you is imparting your goodness and happiness (achieved by principles 1 and 2) into the world.  This can be big or small.  It may even just be smiling at a stranger (or as we call them, 'friends you haven't met yet').
